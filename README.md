# iOS-calculator
First project with Swift, making a calculator app

Unfinished application in its current state.
At the moment, the calculator can only add, subtract, and multiply integers. 

Hoping to implement the following in the future:
* division
* decimals
* when equals key is pressed, it will use the last mode entered
* history
* solve for x
